# RPEN - Connected Pen

RPEN (Remote Pen & Air Pen) is an innovative connected pen project developed as part of the DEEP (Digital Embedded Electronics Project) program at ESEO. This pen allows users to write on a screen remotely via Bluetooth, providing a practical and interactive solution for teaching or creative applications.

## Features

- **Remote Writing:** The pen uses position sensors to capture movements and transcribe them onto a TFT screen.
- **Interactive Modes:**
  - **Writing Mode:** Draw with customizable colors and sizes.
  - **Calibration Mode:** Re-center the cursor on the screen.
  - **Erase Mode:** Remove drawings by overlaying white lines.
- **Style Customization:**
  - Modify drawing size and color via dedicated buttons.
- **Interactive Screen:** The pen pairs with a TFT screen controlled by a microcontroller receiving data via UART Bluetooth.

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware
- **Connected Pen:**
  - Microcontroller based on the Bluepill board.
  - MPU6050 sensor for motion detection.
  - WS2812S RGB LED for indicating the current color.
  - Buttons for functionality control.
- **TFT Screen:**
  - Controlled via SPI.
  - UART Bluetooth interface for receiving data.

### Software
- **Data Transmission:**
  - Motion data and parameters (color, size, mode) are sent as Bluetooth frames.
- **Core Algorithm:**
  - The pen stores motion and parameters in variables.
  - The screen interprets the data to draw or perform the corresponding actions.

## Usage

### Pen Controls
- **Button 1:** Writing mode.
- **Button 2:** Change size or color.
- **Button 3:** Erase the screen or activate erase-by-drawing mode.

To navigate the menus, tilt the pen in the desired direction, similar to a Wii controller.

### Tests
The project underwent various tests:
- Verification of the microcontrollerâ€™s power supply.
- Display testing on the TFT screen.
- Changing colors and sizes using buttons.
- Bluetooth functionality for data transmission.
